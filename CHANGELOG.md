## pre.524

**BREAKING CHANGE**

Kotlin/JS Legacy compiler support removed

## pre.506

**BREAKING CHANGE**

Strict `createContext` signature (aligned with TS version)

## pre.482

**BREAKING CHANGE**

`fun StyledElement.grow(grow: Grow)` renamed to `fun StyledElement.flex(flex: Flex)`. Please update your code accordingly if you're using `kotlin-css`.

## pre.467

**BREAKING CHANGE**

`kotlin-browser` package structure changed:

* `canvas` -> `web.canvas`
* `dom.geometry` -> `web.geometry`
* `dom.html` -> `web.html`
* `dom.svg` -> `web.svg`
* `dom` -> `web.dom`
* `media` -> `web.media`

## pre.452

**BREAKING CHANGE**

Core JS declarations from the `kotlinx.js` package were moved to the following packages:

* `js.buffer`
* `js.collections`
* `js.core`
* `js.errors`
* `js.import`
* `js.intl` (ex-`web.intl`)
* `js.promise`
* `js.reflect`
* `js.typedarrays`

## pre.298 — pre.302

Some factory functions were supported in `kotlin-csstype`. Declarations in `kotlin-csstype` were updated.

**BREAKING CHANGE** `auto` and `none` values were generalized for the whole DSL, duplicates of these declarations
were removed.

`BigInt` declaration was added to `kotlin-extensions`.

## pre.297

`kotlin-browser` declarations were introduced. These are browser APIs missing from the standard library.

## pre.296

Refactoring of `kotlin-extensions` has begun. Migration from `kotlinext` to `kotlinx` package is the main goal.

## pre.295

`kotlin-node` declarations were introduced.

## pre.294

`kotlin-webrtc` declarations were introduced.

## pre.292 — pre.293

`kotlin-typescript` declarations were updated.

## pre.291

`kotlin-typescript` declarations were introduced. They are compiler API declarations that can be used for code
transformation or infrastructural tasks.

## pre.287 — pre.290

`kotlin-mui` declarations were updated.

## pre.286

`kotlin-mui` declarations were updated, some utility hooks were supported.

Examples were updated.

## pre.285

`kotlin-mui` declarations were updated.

## pre.284

`Symbol` declaration was added to `kotlin-extensions`.

## pre.283

Low-level API was added to `emotion-css`.

## pre.282

### `kotlin-react` was split into two parts: `kotlin-react` and `kotlin-react-legacy`

`kotlin-react` only supports the new DSL for React elements (`ChildrenBuilder`, aka "no attrs"),
while `kotlin-react-legacy`
provides the familiar `RBuilder` DSL.

If you are migrating from an earlier version and are not interested in migrating to the new API, you should **replace**
the `kotlin-react` dependency with `kotlin-react-legacy` in your project.

If you are migrating from an earlier version and would like to gradually migrate to the new API, you should **add**
the `kotlin-react-legacy` dependency to your project.

If you are migrating from an earlier version and would like to migrate to the new API at once, resolve all the
compilation errors you encounter. Good luck :)

If you are a new user of `kotlin-react`, just start using the new API and don't worry about the old one.

Technically, there is a third component called `kotlin-react-core` which contains most of the React API, but you don't
need to add it as a direct dependency.

### `kotlin-react-dom` was also split into two parts – you guessed it right — `kotlin-react-dom` and `kotlin-react-dom-legacy`

`kotlin-react-dom` does not depend on `kotlinx.html`, the HTML typings it provides are generated from TypeScript types
directly. They are therefore more complete and up-to-date.

`kotlin-react-dom-legacy` depends on `kolinx.html` and its HTML typings are maintained manually.

To choose the migration path, apply the same reasoning as the one described above for `kotlin-react`: you could either
ignore the new APIs and keep using the old ones, perform a gradual migration, or migrate "cold turkey" style.

Please do note that `kotlin-styled` and `kotlin-styled-next` are only compatible with the legacy API. If you're migrating
to the new API, you are going to need to switch to `kotlin-emotion`.

## pre.280

* New DSL for React elements was implemented. `attrs` block is no longer required.

Before:

```kotlin
val App = fc<Props> {
    Button {
        attrs {
            title = "Submit form"
            disabled = true

            onClick = { event -> }
        }

        +"Submit form"
    }
}
```

After:

```kotlin
val App = FC<Props> {
    Button {
        title = "Submit form"
        disabled = true

        onClick = { event -> }

        +"Submit form"
    }
}
```

## pre.200 — pre.279

* Maven Central group ID was changed to `org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers`
* Interfaces were renamed:
    * `RProps` -> `Props`
    * `RState` -> `State`
* `ElementType` and `ComponentType` interfaces were introduced to describe the type hierarchy in React
* [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) were added
* Intrinsic types in `kotlin-react-dom` were implemented without `kotlinx-html`
* New DSL for CSS was introduced in `kotlin-csstype`
* React Router v6 was supported in `kotlin-react-router-dom`
* New wrappers:
    * `kotlin-react-table`
    * `kotlin-react-query`
    * `kotlin-react-virtual`
    * `kotlin-react-popper`
* Design systems:
    * `kotlin-mui`
    * `kotlin-ring-ui`

## Before pre.156

* Initial implementation is published under `org.jetbrains` group ID
  to [kotlin.jetbrains.space](https://kotlin.jetbrains.space).
